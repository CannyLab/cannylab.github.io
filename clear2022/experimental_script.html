    <h2> Given Hypothesis </h2>
    <h3>Part 1: Training</h3>
    <p>
        During the training phases the children see a video demonstration for how two blicket detectors work, and they are pre-recorded for consistency. We have attached the links here, but cropped out the portion where you can see the researcher giving instructions.

    </p>

    <h3>Part 2: Testing</h3>
    <p>“Look, I have a third blicket detector. It could work like the polka dot one, or it could work like the striped one. Can you figure out how it works and make the detector go, and which blocks make it go?”</p>
    <p>“Great! Is there something else you want to try?”</p>
    <p>Repeat this until they say “no” Stop them after 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>Then ask which objects are blickets by pointing to each one, then clicking the star button. “Is this object a blicket?” (point to leftmost) “Is this object a blicket?” (point to middle) “Is this object a blicket?” (point to rightmost)</p>
    <p>“Now click the shapes that will make the machine go.”</p>
    <p>“Now that you tried it, can you tell me how this machine works?”</p>
